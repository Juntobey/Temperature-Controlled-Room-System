# Arduino Temperature Control System

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Arduino-based temperature control system, designed to maintain a constant temperature in a room during winter.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an assignment to design a temperature control system using an Arduino for a room that needs to be kept at a constant temperature between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius. This is crucial for storing objects that are sensitive to temperature fluctuations.

The system utilizes an Arduino to achieve precise temperature control. It continuously monitors the room temperature and adjusts the heating system accordingly to maintain the desired temperature range.

## Features

* Accurate temperature monitoring using a sensor.
* Automated heating control to maintain the desired temperature range.
* User-friendly interface for easy monitoring and control 

## Hardware Components

* Arduino board 
* Temperature sensor 
* Heating element
* Connecting wires and breadboard

## Software Components

* Arduino IDE

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the hardware components as described in the wiring diagram.
3. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
4. Power on the system and monitor the temperature readings.

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstrating the installation and usage of the temperature control system can be found in the repo.
